## Minh Tran Portfolio
Personal portfolio template built using Reactjs


### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
If you don't have much time to develop a full portfolio yourself, this template is very ideal as you only need to edit the information stored within 1 file to change the content of the whole page. (be mindful that if you want to edit the design, you need the understanding of Reactjs and HTML/CSS/JS) and have to actually dwelve in the codes.
